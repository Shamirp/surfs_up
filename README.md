# surfs_up

## Overview 
Gathering information about temperature trends for W. Avy before opening this surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

•	The summer and winter temperatures have a very similar standard deviation value. This means that most of the temperature values within the datasets are very close to the mean values. 

•	The difference between the mean values of the data is less than 3 degrees. This concludes that business should not see a huge drop off between the winter and summer seasons and if so, temperature is not a deciding variable. 

•	The minimum value for the December data is 56 degrees. This seems to be an outlier of the dataset, however, can impact ice cream sales. 


## Summary

The graphs above depict the frequency of each temperature’s occurrence in the dataset. The June bar graph shows a consistent number of temperatures of 75 degrees and higher. This will create steady business for the surf and ice cream shop. On the other hand, the bar graph for December shows an equal number of occurrences for temperatures above and below 73 degrees. This will cause inconsistent business and may have a slight impact on ice cream sales.
